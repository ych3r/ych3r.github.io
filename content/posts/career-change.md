> As a young professional in cybersecurity, do you often feel so dumb that you can't understand some concepts? Maybe my experience can help.

### My Background

I studied Information Security in college. We had the usual foundational CS and math courses, along with cryptography. Back then, the security field seemed straightforward—either you were an attacker or a defender—even though I had no idea how either actually worked.

Later, I interned at two companies, where I learned about web pentesting and Active Directory security. I thought I was cool because I could "hack a machine." But I fell into the certification trap and stayed there for years. I believed that once I got my OSCP, I'd land a great job and be set for life. The truth? I never passed the exam and I still got a decent job.

Since I did well in undergrad, I came to the U.S. for grad school. That’s where I met some truly smart people and started to realize how far behind I was in core computer science. Professors assumed cybersecurity students were already programming experts, but I wasn’t. I struggled. I knew all about vulnerabilities, attack methodologies, and bug bounty business, but I had no idea how the technology worked under the hood. I never read the source code.

Eventually, I landed an internship and then a full-time role as a cloud security operations engineer. I didn’t need to pass LeetCode-style interviews, unlike my SWE friends. But because no one expected me to code, I quickly got bored with the repetitive work. Worse, I noticed that developers looked down on security. They were the ones fixing bugs and our findings were often seen as annoying or low-priority.

### Pros and Cons

With all these doubts, I began to ask: what if I became a developer? Would that be smarter?

**As a Cybersecurity Professional**  
**Pros:**
- Learn about cool attack techniques.
- Feel like a hacker.
- Easier path to senior roles (since I already had experience).  

**Cons:**
- Spend a lot of time arguing about insecure configs.
- Most tools are just scripts, not real software.
- Lower salary compared to SWE.

**As a Software Engineer**  
**Pros:**
- Build useful, impactful tools.
- Fewer pointless meetings.
- Gain deeper understanding of how products really work.  

**Cons:**
- Honestly, it’s harder than security, as you've got tons to learn.

Eventually, I switched to a dev role within the same department and it completely changed how I saw both fields.

### Engineer vs. Analyst

YouTube and LinkedIn made it seem like cybersecurity and software development are totally separate careers. That confused me for a long time. But now I see: **security is part of the software development lifecycle.** The real distinction is not "security vs development," but rather **analyst vs engineer**.

- The analyst finds the problem.  
- The engineer solves the problem.

Both roles matter, but I prefer writing code.

Since switching, I've learned so much about how software actually works. I even started reading the source code of new CVEs. And you know what? HackTheBox got easier—and more fun—because of my web dev skills.

### Summary

Always aim high because there are no shortcuts. I skipped LeetCode and missed the SWE opportunity early on. I avoided development skills, and that became the bottleneck in my security career.

If you're like me, if you want to be a great hacker, **become a developer first**. You simply can’t skip that step.
