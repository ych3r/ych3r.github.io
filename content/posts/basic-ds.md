> Data structure is the basis of basics.

I took the data structure and algorithms class back in college, and I probably got a pretty good grade because I remember that I liked it. But because I learned that in C, and I've never used C to do anything, after switching to security, I completely forgot about DSA.

Now that I work as a software engineer, I have to pick it up... fast.
