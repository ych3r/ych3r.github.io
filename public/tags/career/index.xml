      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a young professional in cybersecurity, do you often feel so dumb that you can&amp;rsquo;t understand some concepts? Maybe my experience can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-background&#34;&gt;My Background&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I studied Information Security in college. We had the usual foundational CS and math courses, along with cryptography. Back then, the security field seemed straightforward—either you were an attacker or a defender—even though I had no idea how either actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, I interned at two companies, where I learned about web pentesting and Active Directory security. I thought I was cool because I could &amp;ldquo;hack a machine.&amp;rdquo; But I fell into the certification trap and stayed there for years. I believed that once I got my OSCP, I&amp;rsquo;d land a great job and be set for life. The truth? I never passed the exam and I still got a decent job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
