[{"categories":["etc"],"content":" As a young professional in cybersecurity, do you often feel so dumb that you can\u0026rsquo;t understand some concepts? Maybe my experience can help.\nMy Background I studied Information Security in college. We had the usual foundational CS and math courses, along with cryptography. Back then, the security field seemed straightforward—either you were an attacker or a defender—even though I had no idea how either actually worked.\nLater, I interned at two companies, where I learned about web pentesting and Active Directory security. I thought I was cool because I could \u0026ldquo;hack a machine.\u0026rdquo; But I fell into the certification trap and stayed there for years. I believed that once I got my OSCP, I\u0026rsquo;d land a great job and be set for life. The truth? I never passed the exam and I still got a decent job.\nSince I did well in undergrad, I came to the U.S. for grad school. That’s where I met some truly smart people and started to realize how far behind I was in core computer science. Professors assumed cybersecurity students were already programming experts, but I wasn’t. I struggled. I knew all about vulnerabilities, attack methodologies, and bug bounty business, but I had no idea how the technology worked under the hood. I never read the source code.\nEventually, I landed an internship and then a full-time role as a cloud security operations engineer. I didn’t need to pass LeetCode-style interviews, unlike my SWE friends. But because no one expected me to code, I quickly got bored with the repetitive work. Worse, I noticed that developers looked down on security. They were the ones fixing bugs and our findings were often seen as annoying or low-priority.\nPros and Cons With all these doubts, I began to ask: what if I became a developer? Would that be smarter?\nAs a Cybersecurity Professional\nPros:\nLearn about cool attack techniques. Feel like a hacker. Easier path to senior roles (since I already had experience). Cons:\nSpend a lot of time arguing about insecure configs. Most tools are just scripts, not real software. Lower salary compared to SWE. As a Software Engineer\nPros:\nBuild useful, impactful tools. Fewer pointless meetings. Gain deeper understanding of how products really work. Cons:\nHonestly, it’s harder than security, as you\u0026rsquo;ve got tons to learn. Eventually, I switched to a dev role within the same department and it completely changed how I saw both fields.\nEngineer vs. Analyst YouTube and LinkedIn made it seem like cybersecurity and software development are totally separate careers. That confused me for a long time. But now I see: security is part of the software development lifecycle. The real distinction is not \u0026ldquo;security vs development,\u0026rdquo; but rather analyst vs engineer.\nThe analyst finds the problem. The engineer solves the problem. Both roles matter, but I prefer writing code.\nSince switching, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so much about how software actually works. I even started reading the source code of new CVEs. And you know what? HackTheBox got easier—and more fun—because of my web dev skills.\nSummary Always aim high because there are no shortcuts. I skipped LeetCode and missed the SWE opportunity early on. I avoided development skills, and that became the bottleneck in my security career.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me, if you want to be a great hacker, become a developer first. You simply can’t skip that step.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/career-change/","tags":["career"],"title":"Career Change: From Cybersecurity to Software Development"},{"categories":["bug bounty"],"content":"So, I almost submit my first valid bug report\u0026hellip;\nWhat Happened The other night, I finally decided to give bug bounty a try. I found a VDP program and let ChatGPT write me a recon script. That recon script returned with several subdomains, and when I went through them, a weird domain caught my eye. What the hell is \u0026lsquo;whoami.xx.xx.com\u0026rsquo;?\nOut of curiosity, I opened that in my browser. Holy cow, it looks like a debugging page with an internal IP! I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if that counts but ChatGPT said it was a valid information disclosure bug. Before embarrassing myself, I wanted to figure out what this \u0026lsquo;whoami\u0026rsquo; subdomain does.\nIt turns out the whoami subdomain is typically mapped to a developer debug service. It echoes back how the server sees the request \u0026ndash; including headers, IP addresses, and internal network info. From my experience, I know that internal IP can chain with other vulnerabilities which means at least it\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026rsquo;low severity\u0026rsquo;.\nSo, I submitted the report and got a \u0026lsquo;duplicate\u0026rsquo; a few hours later. But that makes sense! I only ran a basic script \u0026ndash; and chances are, many others had already found the same thing before me. The good thing is, that means I found a valid bug!\nWhat Is an Information Disclosure Bug As the name suggests, any sensitive data leak can be information disclosure bug. But this information must be sensitive enough that the company don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be public.\nWhere to Find Info Leaks Can be anywhere as long as it\u0026rsquo;s in scope.\nExposed Subdomains: dev, staging, test, debug, internal Public Files / Directories: credential files JavaScript Files: API keys, usernames, maybe passwords Response Headers: vulnerable software version Error Pages: File path, SQL error, debug messages Publicly Accessible API Responses: sensitive information My Recon Workflow This type of bug heavily rely on recon and you must be faster than anyone else. Thus, writing a script is the only option.\nSubdomains: find as much as possible and monitor their changes. subfinder -d target.com -silent -o subs.txt httpx -l subs.txt -silent -status-code -title -web-server -tech-detect -o live.txt Headers: look for info leak httpx -l live.txt -status-code -web-server -tech-detect -title -o headers.txt Interesting Files \u0026amp; Directories ffuf -u https://FUZZ.target.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -mc 200,403 -t 20 -o ffuf.json JS Files gau target.com | grep \u0026#39;\\.js$\u0026#39; | sort -u \u0026gt; jsfiles.txt python3 LinkFinder/linkfinder.py -i https://target.com/app.js -o cli cat jsfiles.txt | xargs curl -s | grep -Ei \u0026#34;secret|token|api|auth\u0026#34; Error Page: look for debug info, stack traces, SQL errors, Path disclosure Final Thoughts Last but not least, an information disclosure bug is important but it\u0026rsquo;s not like other security bugs. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need a technical background to understand it, maybe you accidentally see leaked information when casually browsing their website.\nHopefully, my blog inspires you to some extent. If you\u0026rsquo;re new to bug bounty like me, don\u0026rsquo;t waste your time on tutorial \u0026ndash; do recon on real target and learn by doing. Even duplicates mean you\u0026rsquo;re doing it right. Anyway, I have to go refine my recon tool, see you ;)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/duplicate-report/","tags":["information disclosure","recon"],"title":"Duplicate Report"},{"categories":null,"content":" I\u0026rsquo;m a developer \u0026amp; hacker. *I think I build (hopefully)secure software during the day.
